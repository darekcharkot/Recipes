0.2.2
~ A MethodStruct class now implements #to_proc and so can be passed as a block
	argument

0.2.1
~ Fixes in how argument verification deals with hashes

0.2.0
+ Allow user functions to overwrite the generated attr readers
+ Require_all option that checks if all arguments have been provided on
  initialization
+ Require_presence option that checks if all arguments are non-nil on
  initialization
+ Configurable defaults for the options

0.1.5
+ Support blocks

0.1.4
~ Implement [] with a method instead of an alias to make mocks not care which
	one is called

0.1.3
+ Make it possible to call MethodStructs using [] like regular lambdas

0.1.1
+ Implement #eql? in terms of #==

0.1.0

~ #== an #hash are now overloaded in MethodStructs so that two MethodStructs
  of the same class initialized with the same arguments are equal
